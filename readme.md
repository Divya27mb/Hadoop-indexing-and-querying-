## Hadoop Indexing and Querying
- I made two mapreduce programs. First one go through all the documents and using mapreduce functionality send you text file containing all the word and in which documents that word is present.
- Second one send all the documents which are having that word with offset from the starting point of the document.
- I also made two query codes, which take text file containing query words. First one search all the query word in given document and send in which document it is present.
- Second one send the document name and the line containing the word.
