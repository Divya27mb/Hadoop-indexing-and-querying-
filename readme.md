## Hadoop Indexing and Querying
- I made two mapreduce program. One is go through all the documents and using mapreduce functionality send you text file containing all the word and in which documents it is present.
- Second one send all the documents which are having that word with offset from the starting point of the document.
- I also made two query codes, which take text file containing query words. First one search all the query word in given document and send in which document it is available.
- Second one send the document name and the line containing the word.
